<h1>Imperium Polaris</h1>
Imperium Polaris is a climate-based biome generator intended for the SMP Imperium server. It provides a band of "temperate" biomes between the arctic and the desert.

<h2>Configuration</h2>
Currently, the only configuration option available is the width of the 'middle' biomes band. By default, it is set to 1000. Setting it larger will result in a wider band of biomes, while setting it smaller will result in a narrower, thinner band.

<h2>Building</h2>
